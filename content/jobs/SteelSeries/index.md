- Researched ways to make SteelSeries Moments software faster at detecting in-game events

- Explored SIFT and lightweight neural networks for feature matching

- Built a custom dataset of gaming icons and backgrounds from Twitch/YouTube footage with synthetic transformations and augmentations

- Designed and trained a teacher–student framework combining classical and neural methods

- Achieved 12.4× speedup over traditional SIFT while keeping good accuracy

- Validated the approach on 127k test samples with ~81% accuracy

- Reflected results: clear speed gain, with some trade-off in precision
