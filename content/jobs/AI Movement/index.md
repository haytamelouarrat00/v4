- Spearheaded research on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), achieving a 30% improvement in agent collaboration
  efficiency in complex environments.
- Engineered Multi-agent Transformers and recurrent neural network-based algorithms, enabling adaptive strategy learning
  and enhancing agent decision-making in dynamic scenarios.
- Leveraged intrinsic reward mechanisms to optimize learning efficiency, resulting in faster convergence to optimal
  policies even under sparse reward conditions.
- Enhanced model capabilities in autonomous decision-making through advanced sequential modeling, leading to more robust
  behavior under limited feedback situations.
