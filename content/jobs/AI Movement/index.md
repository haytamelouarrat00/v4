- Design and implementation of image-based and direct visual servoing controllers using Feature-Based VS formulations, focusing on stability and convergence properties.
- Integration of Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting for visual localization, enabling high-precision navigation from sparse images without explicit depth sensors.
- Developed end-to-end Python pipelines for camera models and rendering to evaluate robustness in novel-view tracking and visual servoing.
