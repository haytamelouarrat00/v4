This project implements an Audio Profanity Censor, a robust deep learning-based system for automated detection and
censorship of profanity in audio content. The solution leverages OpenAI's Whisper model for precise speech recognition
and implements sophisticated audio processing techniques to seamlessly replace inappropriate content with customizable
beep sounds. This project uses reinforcement learning to train the model for accurate profanity detection and adapts to
different audio inputs to enhance the performance of the censoring process.
