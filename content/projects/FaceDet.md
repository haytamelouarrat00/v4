The Face Detection Project implements a real-time face detection system using OpenCV and Python. The project captures
video from a webcam, converts frames to grayscale, detects faces using a Haar cascade classifier, and draws rectangles
around detected faces. The project demonstrates the use of OpenCV for computer vision tasks.
