This project implements Quinza15, a traditional Moroccan card game, as a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)
environment. Quinza15 is a strategic game where players compete to maximize their rewards by forming combinations of
cards with a sum of 15. This project uses reinforcement learning to train multiple agents to play the game, learn
optimal strategies, and adapt to the behavior of other players.
