We build a visual‑servoing simulator and interactive UI that renders a 3D view using homography, projects features into a camera view, and
iteratively updates the camera pose to reach a desired view, with static/dynamic tracking and controller comparisons; we
use Python with NumPy for math, OpenCV for feature matching and image processing, Matplotlib for plots, and Gradio for the interface, while building the core pipeline from scratch (camera model, projection/
back‑projection, interaction matrices, control loop, and simulation harness).
